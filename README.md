# PER-QT/REVTeX

This is a [Quarto extension] to facilitate the creation of journal articles that use the [REVTeX macro package].

This extension is currently "pre-alpha;" features are undocumented, missing, or not fully implemented. Experiment with it at your own risk!

If you are interested in trying the extension out or contributing to development, please contact Astra Sword at astra.sword@open.ac.uk.
